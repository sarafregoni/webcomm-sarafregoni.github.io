# Boomerang Cafè's Website

---

## The idea
- It's a brand new website for Boomerang Cafè, a local pub that I know very well.
- It offers a general presentation of the pub: its offer, the contacts, the location and open hours.
- It also presents an interactive section to email/message the pub.

## Aim of the project
- Present the main characteristics of the pub
- Allow interactions between customers and the service providers
- Keep old customers updated and find new ones.

## The tools and languages I used - HTML  
- I used HTML language to create the "bone structure" of my website.

---

## The tools and languages I used - HYPERLINKS
- Hyperlinks allowed me including external references to my website, e.g. the original menu website of the cafè.

---

## The tools and languages I used - IMAGES
- I selected the most representative pictures of the pub's ambience and menu offers.

---

## The tools and languages I used - CSS  
- CSS was crucial to reflect the pub's aesthetic through different parts of the website and to make it clearer and easier for end-users.

---

## The tools and languages I used - JAVASCRIPT  
- The JS part was necessary for the two photo galleries to slide through the different pictures I selected.
